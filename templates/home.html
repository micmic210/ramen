                    </div>
                    <p>Our Mussels Ramen is a celebration of seasonal local ingredients and meticulous
                        craftsmanship, designed to delight and warm the hearts of our community during
                        winter.</p>
                    <p>This dish features a clear, delicate chicken soup seasoned with fine French salt,
                        offering a
                        light yet comforting base. Fresh mussels are steamed with white wine and garlic,
                        infusing
                        the broth with a subtle, aromatic richness. Butter-grilled scallops add a savory
                        depth,
                        perfectly complementing the mussels.</p>
                    <p>To complete the dish, we garnish it with fresh rukkora leaves for a touch of
                        bitterness and
                        vibrant chives on the side, enhancing both flavor and presentation. The result is a
                        bowl of
                        ramen that is not only warming but also refreshingly light, offering a clean and
                        balanced
                        taste that leaves you feeling rejuvenated.</p>
                    <p>A perfect harmony of local flavors and Japanese ramen mastery, Mussels Ramen is our
                        winter-special offering crafted to bring warmth and joy to your table.</p>
